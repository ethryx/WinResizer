Window Resizer
==============
Language: C#

This application will prompt you to select a window (usually a game) and allow you to do the following:

- remove all windows borders
- set the resolution
- choose what monitor it will be placed on

Requirements:
- microsoft .net framework

Note: It does not work for all games. I've only tested it on a handful of games myself since this is a personal project. However, if you would like it to work for a certain game, feel free to add a new issue to the project.

Games Tested:
- counter-strike: source
- counter-strike 1.6
- team fortress 2
- portal
